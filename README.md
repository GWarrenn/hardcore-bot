# hardcore-bot

This project is an ode to hardcore music and the words the fine folks at [Stereogum](https://www.stereogum.com/) use to describe the visceral feelings it evokes.

I love hardcore punk music. It seems kind of silly to add "hardcore" in front of the word punk, as if to say "yes, I like punk music but I want you to know that I bench press and I'm tough as shit." But the "hardcore" label is more of a distinct genre signifier than some kind of virtue signalling. Hardcore is the more aggressive, faster, and meaner child of punk music, and it has a distinct sound that I <i>fucking love</i>. My first introduction to the genre was through living in Washington DC, which laid the foundation of the genre's ethos with legendary bands like Fugazi, Bad Brains, and Minor Threat. One of the things I love about hardcore music, besides the "screw you" attitude that I find incredibly cathartic in an increasingly frustrating world, is the imagery that is proliferated in the music's lyrics and art. My closet is now full of shirts from bands that I can't wear on Zoom calls for fear of upsetting coworkers. I once wore a Drug Church shirt during a weekend trip with my girlfriend's family; thankfully, her parents got a kick out of it and her Dad promptly recommended a few of his favorite books on punk music (they're very cool).  

I'm not a cultural expert, I don't have my finger to the pulse of any music scene, or any scene really, so like most people I get my music recommendations distilled by those that do the hard work of sifting through everything to give me their recommendations. No site on the whole Internet has had more of an impact on my musical taste than [Stereogum](https://www.stereogum.com/). In addition to having very good music recommendations, they also have a thriving commentariat that they actively engage with, including a weekly [roundup of the best/worst comments of the week](https://www.stereogum.com/category/columns/shut-up-dude/). 

Stereogum slowly introduced me to more and more hardcore bands over the years as I've pushed my comfort zone, listening to more and more intense, snarling music. One of the best things about how Stereogum covers the genre is how editor Tom Breihan describes it. For example, this is how he describes [Enforced's Hemmhorage](https://www.stereogum.com/2111306/enforced-hemorrhage/music/):

> Midway through “Hemorrhage,” there’s a sudden riff-change that makes me feel like my eyeballs are about to explode.

These descriptions are one of my favorite parts of the Stereogum, most of which come from the [monthly hardcore music roundup](https://www.stereogum.com/category/columns/let-the-roundup-begin/), which is a treasure trove of vivid descriptions of how the music makes Tom feel. Awhile back I started collecting some of my favorite of these quotes and saved them into a google doc. Next, I decided to share these quotes with the world by creating a Twitter bot hosted on Heroku that would pull the quotes from the Google sheet. 

On the technical side of things, this project is actually very simple. I store the quotes in a google sheet that I manually update with my favorite quotes. In the future I may explore the viability of using this as a training corpus to more exhaustively comb through Stereogum's archives to find more gems. The [python](https://github.com/GWarrenn/hardcore-bot/blob/main/hardcore_bot.py) script simply authenticates with Google to connect and randomly select a specific quote, then authenticates with my a newly created Twitter account to push the quotes to Twitter using [Tweepy's](https://docs.tweepy.org/en/stable/) really intuitive and powerful capabilities. The code is hosted in a [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) that is configured to execute the python code everyday at 12:00 PM ET using the [Advanced Scheduler](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/advanced-scheduler) Heroku add-on.
